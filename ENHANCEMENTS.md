- CISA KEV catalog integration
- MITRE ATT&CK framework automatic mapping
- Threat actor profiling (APT28, Lazarus, FIN7)

#### 3. **ML-Powered Analysis Engine** ✅
- Advanced risk scoring (1000-point scale)
- Attack path graph generation
- Critical path identification
- Vulnerability type classification
- Trend analysis and prediction

#### 4. **AI Remediation Engine** ✅
